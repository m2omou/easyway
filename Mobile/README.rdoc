To add all external libraries on the projet you need to use CocoaPods.

If you don't have cocoapods :
`sudo gem install cocoapods`

Then go in the directory of the project where there is the Podfile and launch this command :
`pod install` 

When the installation is done, you can finally launch xcode. Click on `accessibility.xcworkspace`
