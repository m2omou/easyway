EASYWAY is a collaborative application for route calculation and navigation aids for disabled persons. Our vision is to offer the best route, calculated or recalculated, taking into account the obstacles and the specifics of your disability.

We also reference points of interests accessible to persons with reduced mobility.

### Obstacles

EASYWAY lets you know in advance and as you navigate, the "temporary" or "permanent" obstacles on your way. Less surprise on the road! You can adjust your route...
